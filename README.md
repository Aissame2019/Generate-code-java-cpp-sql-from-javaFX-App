# Class Diagram Code Generator

The **Class Diagram Code Generator** is a JavaFX application designed to simplify software development by generating Java, C++, and SQL code from class diagrams. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to use and set up the application.

## Introduction

Developing software often starts with designing class diagrams to represent the structure of your application. The Class Diagram Code Generator streamlines the coding process by automatically generating code snippets (Java, C++, SQL) from your input class diagrams. This accelerates development and ensures code consistency.

## Features

- **Diagram Input**: Create and modify class and interface diagrams with an intuitive GUI.

- **Code Generation**: Generate Java, C++, and SQL code from the input diagrams with a single button click.

- **Output Folder**: Code is generated and saved in a folder within the application directory.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/class-diagram-generator.git
   cd class-diagram-generator

2. **Usage**:

- **Launch the Application**: Start the application from your desktop or command line.

- **Input Diagram**: Use the GUI to create and modify class and interface diagrams, including relationships.

- **Generate Code**: Click the "Generate" button. The application will generate Java, C++, and SQL code based on your input diagrams.

- **Output Folder**: The generated code is saved in a folder within the application directory.
